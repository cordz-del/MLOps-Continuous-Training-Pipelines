## Overview

This repository is focused on production-grade MLOps, demonstrating continuous model management through automated data ingestion, retraining triggers, evaluation, and deployment. The goal is to maintain up-to-date, high-performing AI models while monitoring performance and mitigating model drift.

## Why This Repository?

- **Continuous Model Management:**  
  Demonstrates the ability to continuously update, retrain, and monitor AI models in production. This is critical for managing model drift and ensuring long-term performance.

- **Automation & Efficiency:**  
  Showcases the setup of CI/CD pipelines for model training, evaluation, and deployment, ensuring models remain scalable and up-to-date.

- **Production-Grade MLOps:**  
  Highlights techniques for automated data ingestion, retraining triggers, model versioning, and performance monitoringâ€”key components of a robust MLOps strategy.

## Key Features

- **Data Refresh & Ingestion Pipelines:**  
  Scripts to automatically ingest new data, clean it, and preprocess it for model retraining.

- **Automated Model Retraining:**  
  Logic that triggers retraining of models when performance drops or when new data is available, ensuring models stay relevant.

- **Evaluation & Validation:**  
  Code that evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, token efficiency, and response latency to decide whether to deploy a new model version.

- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  Automated pipelines (using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Terraform) that test, validate, and deploy retrained models to production seamlessly.

- **Monitoring & Alerting:**  
  Integration with cloud monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch) to track model performance and trigger alerts for anomalies or degradation.

## Architecture

The system is structured into the following layers:
1. **Data Ingestion & Processing:**  
   Continuously collects new data and pre-processes it for training.
2. **Automated Retraining Engine:**  
   Triggers model retraining based on defined performance thresholds and new data availability.
3. **Evaluation & Validation:**  
   Assesses retrained models using key performance metrics.
4. **Deployment Pipeline:**  
   Automatically deploys new model versions via CI/CD pipelines.
5. **Monitoring & Alerting:**  
   Uses cloud-native tools to monitor model performance and alert on issues.
